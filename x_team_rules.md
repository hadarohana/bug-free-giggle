# X-Team 66 Rules

These rules establish how our team will assign tasks,
track progress on each task, and communicate with each other 
when a member is unable to complete a task that has been assigned to that member.

This document helps individual members understand the team's expectations,
and will hopefully lead to productive team work with fewer conflicts
and missed deadlines.

## How we will assign (and reassign) tasks
* In-person
  * Make a list of tasks and assign to team members based on preference and strengths. 
  * Reassign tasks after discussion and if team member feels they would be more productive on another task.
* Online
  * Use Facebook group messaging to quickly contact group members and assign tasks and discuss reassignments as needed.
