# X-Team 66 Rules

These rules establish how our team will assign tasks,
track progress on each task, and communicate with each other 
when a member is unable to complete a task that has been assigned to that member.

This document helps individual members understand the team's expectations,
and will hopefully lead to productive team work with fewer conflicts
and missed deadlines.

## How we will assign (and reassign) tasks
* In-person
  * Make a list of tasks and assign to team members based on preference and strengths. 
  * Reassign tasks after discussion and if team member feels they would be more productive on another task.
* Online
  * Use Facebook group messaging to quickly contact group members and assign tasks and discuss reassignments as needed.

## How will we will track progress (and follow-up) on completion of tasks
* We will check in on our Facebook group and create a google document with tasks and completion.
* Peer review each other's work to make sure that nothing is missed.
* Make it a priority to finish tasks early and not get behind.

## How will will communicate difficulties with a task assigned to us
* Let other group members know as soon as you are having trouble.
* Respond to group members fast when they are helping you.
* Don't wait until the last second to say you are having difficulties.
* Use a google drive sheet to mark off responsibilities as they are completed.

## How we will back up each other to ensure that deadlines are not missed
* Be up to date with the Google Doc.
* Milestones set significantly before deadlines. 
* Let teammates know when you're having trouble. 
* Agree on times to meet to discuss our progress and any difficulties experienced.
* Be understanding of eachother if there is a problem accomplishing milestones, but make sure to notify all group members promptly.
